# Chapter 1 and Intros 

## Introduction

### Course Intro

Welcome to __CITC 1310: PROGRAMMING 1__.  If that is NOT the course you were looking for, you may not be in the right place!  Or I may not be in the right place...depending on how many of you stand up and walk out now.

This course is NOT an introductory programming class.  As a prerequisite, you should have taken Intro to Programming and Java Programming I.  This course WILL move a pace assuming you have some programming experience. If you have concerns about that, we need to speak offline.

In this course we're going to learn C# development using Windows Forms applications. For some of you this may be your first experience with GUI development -- we will be making applications that have Graphical User Interface, rather than only doing command line development.  

## Instructor 

My name is Ryan Tate. I am an adjunct professor here at NSCC, which basically just means I am a part-time instructor, but I have educational and professional experience in software development and programming. 

I am the Chief Technology Officer for a litigation support company. I do software development and oversee all aspects of our technical operations.

Prior to starting in the private sector in 2020, I spent 16 years in government in the public safety and IT spaces.  I left the City of Franklin as an Assistant IT Director.  I do not use C# in my current job, but at the COF I was involved in several C# projects (integrations to existing products).

I have a Masters in Computer Science from the University of West Georgia, and two Bachelors degress (one in Computer Science, one in Criminal Justice) both from Troy University.

## Student Intros 

I'd like to take just a few minutes to go around and have you introduce yourselves.  If you'll just give me your full name and preferred name (if different).

## Expectations 

The course syllabus is out there, I'm not going to read it word for word, but I want to give you an overview of my expectations for this class.

- Attendance: I have to report attendance initially but afterward, I won't take official attendance. However, it is expected that you show up for class. If you are struggling and you're here, I will do what I can to work with you and help you through the course. If you're not showing up and you have trouble, you're going to be on your own!
- Timeliness: This is a long block of time, I get that, but please be on time. I will start on time. We will almost never go the full time block because I can't teach that long and you can't actually absorb that much material. I will teach for typically at most 90 minutes and the remaining time will be lab time if you wish to use it. Once my lecture is finished, you're free to go and work on your assignments on your own time.
- Help: If you have trouble with the material, or with ANYTTHING that I can help you with, whether that's helping you to find the right resources for something outside of class or whatever that might be - PLEASE PLEASE reach out. Much like attendance, I am not going to chase you down. If you aren't doing well on assignments, I don't know if that means you don't understand, or you just aren't putting in the effort. If it UP TO YOU to seek out help. But please do so!
- Deadlines: these exist for a reason. If you need to work around a deadline, we need to have a conversation as soon as possible when you know theres an issue but DEFINITELY before the deadline actually passes. I reserve the right to penalize or simply not accept late work otherwise. There may be cases where I need or want to discuss solutions after the deadline passes and I can't accept your work after I've given the answer!
- Academic Honestly: this is a big one, folks. DO. YOUR. OWN. WORK.  I will check!  I have discovered students using internet code before, and the consequences are severe. Best case scenario, you're getting a 0 for that assignment.  Worst case, you can fail the entire course and face academic discipline from the College. Beyond that, if you make it out into the real world in a job, there won't be internet code to steal!  You are here to LEARN and you can't do that if you're just turning in someone else's code. Please don't do this!

## Techincal Requirements

We will be using Visual Studio as the IDE in this course.  Visual Studio Community Edition is Free, but to develop Windows Forms you will have to have...you guessed it...Windows.  I am a mac user primarily, but to do this course, you are going to need a Windows device.

You'll need to download and install Visual Studio, and make sure to select the Desktop development (C# / Windows Forms). It does look a little different from the book exmaples as versions have changed.

Visual Studio is NOT the same as Visual Studio Code.  VS Code is a text editor, NOT a full IDE. You will need the full-blown Visual Studio for this course.

## Teaching Style

Tonight we're going to cover some introductory stuff and I will use a little PowerPoint to do that. Typically speaking, I HATE PowerPoint, I will do my very best to NOT teach death-by-powerpoint and instead we'll work as much as possible in example based setting where I'm talking through working in the IDE. I taught JavaScript last semester and after the first night did not use PP at all. I'm hoping that we'll be able to do the same here.

## COVID

In today's world, we can't ignore the ongoing impact of the COVID pandemic. This is an in-person class, and as I mentioned in the attendance section, you are expected to attend. However, if you are exposed to or confirmed to have COVID, you should stay out of class during the recommended quarantine period. Contact me ASAP for instruction on how to proceed and we'll work to arrange either a zoom session during class or I'll recommend reading etc.  

If __I__ have to quarantine, we'll have to move the class fully to Zoom for the duration of impact, hopefully just one class given that this is a once-per-week course. __PLEASE GET IN THE HABIT OF CHECKING D2L AND YOUR EMAIL BEFORE YOU LEAVE HOME/WORK/WHEREVER YOU COME FROM TO COME TO THIS CLASS!__  I will post any changes there. I will try to make any updates by the morning of class unless the nature of the change dictates otherwise--i.e., if I found out at 3pm that I couldn't be in class, then that's the earliest I can let you know!
